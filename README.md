I use the [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) color scheme for
everything—it's wonderful.

ThinkPad 13 (2017): Arch Linux, zsh, nvim, [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/),
[st](https://st.suckless.org/)

MacBook Air (2020): macOS, zsh, nvim, Amethyst, iTerm2

## Goals

My hardware, operating systems, and the tools that run on them are carefully
chosen.

- They must be **lightweight** since I tend to keep my devices for a long time.
- They must **maximize workflow** without getting in the way.
- They must **use screen space efficiently** since I have small laptops and
  don't usually use a monitor, instead keeping the laptop on a stand with
  keyboard and mouse.

> ignore it because it's never in your way. —[Hunor Karamán](https://hex22.org/wiki/manifesto/)

## Non-goals

- Photo shoots
- Changing the setup every few months. I prefer to have something that fits my
  workflow and gives me the freedom to focus on bigger ideas.

## Screenshots

### Linux

(New screenshots of Arch coming soon! It looks the same though.)

The typeface in the terminal, status bar, and code editor is Source Code Pro.

Sorry, I had a lot of stuff open while taking these.

I don't typically use gaps if not using an external monitor. I just did it for
the screenshots.
