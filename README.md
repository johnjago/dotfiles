Soon to be:

## Why this setup works well for me

…and why it might not work for you.

My standard desk setup is a 13.3" laptop on a stand, with keyboard and mouse.
Since I don't typically use an external monitor, I have to make the most of the
screen space I have. That's the driving reason behind a lot of the visual
configuration. With dwm's `alt+b` I can even hide the status bar as long I
remember what applications are in which workspace. So while it doesn't look
pretty, its utility is unmatched for my workflow.

It's also ridiculously lightweight.
